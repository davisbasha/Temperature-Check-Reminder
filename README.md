Temperature Check Reminder!

Purpose: The pupose of this program was to learn how to use if, elif, and else. Depending on the temperature that the user inputs, the program will either tell the user to take action, or wait some more time until theyt have to check the temperature again.

How it Works: The user is asked to enter the temperature. If the temperature that was input is under 59 degrees, a message is displayed to activate the heating system. If the temperature is over 77 degree, a message is displayed to turn on the water sprinklers. However, if it between 59-77 degrees, a message is displayed saying the temperature is ideal. If not ideal, the user is prompted to check againb in 5 minutes. If ideal, the user is promted to chech again in 15 minutes.
